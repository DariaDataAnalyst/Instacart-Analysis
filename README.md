# InstaCartAnalysis

Acting as an analyst for Instacart, I'm diving into their sales data to uncover hidden patterns. 
My goal: to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

# Instacart Data Analysis Project
## Objective

In this project, I take on the role of an analyst for Instacart to explore sales patterns and customer behaviors. The goal is to unearth insights that will inform better customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies.

## Context

Instacart, an established online grocery platform, seeks to refine its marketing efforts. They believe that a one-size-fits-all approach isn't optimal. My analysis aims to segment customers effectively and propose targeted strategies to enhance product sales.

## Key Questions

- What are the peak order times and days?
- When do customers tend to spend the most?
- How can product price ranges improve marketing strategies?
- Which product departments are most popular?
- How do customer demographics and behaviors vary in terms of brand loyalty, regional differences, and purchasing patterns?
## Data Source

The project leverages open-source datasets from Instacart, complemented by specially created customer datasets. These resources are integral to addressing the outlined business questions.

## Stakeholders

The insights derived from this analysis will cater to:

- The Vice President of Marketing
- The Senior Vice President of Sales
- Instacart Customers
The goal is to align marketing strategies with customer preferences and uncover growth opportunities within Instacart's offerings.

## Final Deliverable

For a comprehensive view of my findings and recommendations, please refer to the [Final Project.XLSX](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lP-yk3SBTGCFOzTBK4DvgHIdPFTIktHp/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=117177868168752080465&rtpof=true&sd=true) as well as the [Instacart Analysis zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1do6VQ35yT6k6hMPX3Q6059Kt0HwPr4Rw/view?usp=share_link) containing all data sets, graphs, and reports.

This analysis is not only about uncovering current trends but also about predicting future customer behaviors, thereby enabling Instacart to stay ahead in a competitive market.

## Analysis Criteria

- Descriptive checks have been conducted after importation of data, such as checking
the top and the bottom of the dataframe.
- Whenever a dataframe is altered, checks have been conducted to determine its
shape and basic statistics.

- All subsamples have been exported and saved in the proper folder following a
consistent naming convention.
- Any new columns that have been derived are relevant to the needs of the analysis.
- At least 4 types of data visualizations have been generated to communicate insights
to stakeholders. Visualizations are clearly labeled.

customer information.
- Final report includes evidence of analysis methodology, clear answers to the
questions in this brief, and recommendations for Instacart stakeholders.
